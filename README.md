# Payments_ver2

The customer registers in the system and has one or more Credit Cards, each of which
corresponds to a specific Account in the system. The Client may make a Payment using the
Account.
The payment has one of two statuses: &#39;prepared&#39; or &#39;sent&#39;. (Optional: implement the ability to
generate a pdf-report on payment).
The client has a personal account where he can view information about his payments and
accounts. It is necessary to implement the possibility of sorting:
- payments:
1) by number;
2) by date (old to new, new to old);
- accounts:
1) by number;
2) by account name;
3) by the balance amount on the account.
The client can replenish or block one of his accounts. To unlock the account, the customer
must make a request to unlock.
The system administrator has the rights:
- blocking / unblocking the user;
- blocking / unblocking one of the user&#39;s accounts.
